# SpotifyPlaylist
this scrapes the top 100 billboard charts for the user input date then create a playlist using spotify's api

client_id, client_secret and spotify access token are all hidden as you would have to use your own account instead.
More help on how to do this would be found on this link https://developer.spotify.com/documentation/general/guides/authorization/
